## The idea

A lovely combination of the Marvelous [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) site generator, the Amazing CSS Framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and the best masonry library compatible with ReactJs [React Masonry CSS](https://github.com/paulcollett/react-masonry-css)

## The goal

To offer to anyone an easy fully customisable and opensource website.
